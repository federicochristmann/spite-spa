    <p>
        Recall that the player with the highest bid gets the object, and she pays a price equal to the rival's bid. The player
        with the lowest bid does not get the object, nor she pays for it. The signal reveals your rival's true value
        half of the times.
    </p>

    <p>
        You value the object in <strong>{{ player.private_value }}</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The signal's cost is <strong>{{ player.signal_cost }}</strong>.
    </p>
