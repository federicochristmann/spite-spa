    Second price auction game: bid

{% block content %}

    <p>
        Recall that the player with the highest bid gets the object, and she pays a price equal to the rival's bid. The player
        with the lowest bid does not get the object, nor she pays for it. [TREATMENT 1: The signal reveals your rival's value
        half of the times.] [TREATMENT 2: The signal reveals your rival's value.] [WITHIN TREATMENT: This round you are playing
        against a bot!]
    </p>
    <p>
        You value the object in <strong>{{ player.private_value }}</strong>. If you win the auction, you have
        a payoff of <strong>{{ player.private_value }} - second highest bid</strong>.
    </p>
